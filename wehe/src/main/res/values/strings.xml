        <![CDATA[We would like to invite you to take part in a research project. The purpose of this
        research study is to understand how cellular Internet providers give different performance
        to different network traffic from your smartphone.\n\nFor example, we would like to know if
        a provider is speeding up YouTube traffic and/or slowing down Netflix. We will use this
        information to understand how often this occurs, where this occurs and what are the
        implications.\n\nWe are asking you to participate in this study because you are a smartphone
        user who has installed our app for detecting traffic differentiation. The decision to
        participate in this research project is voluntary. You do not have to participate and you
        can uninstall the app at any time. Even if you begin using the app, you can stop at any
        time. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate.\n\nYou can run tests from the app
        as many or as few times as you like. We would like you to run tests on different networks
        that your mobile device connects to, and at different times of the day.\n\nThe possible
        risks or discomforts of the study are minimal. When you use the app, we will record the
        traffic it generates (including timestamps) and use this data to determine whether your
        Internet service provider (ISP) is interfering with your network traffic in any way. If
        available, we will collect information about your network, signal strength, operating
        system, and coarse-grained location (no more precise than a 1km radius of your location).
        Data concerning the network performance you receive while running tests (including
        timestamps), as well as information about your network, signal strength, operating system
        and jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, province) will be anonymized and made publicly
        available so that others can reproduce our findings. All other data will be shared only with
        co-investigators, and it will not be annotated with any personally identifiable
        information.\n\nThere are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study.
        However, by running the app you may help us learn more about how ISPs interfere with
        Internet traffic from mobile devices. You will not be paid for your participation in this
        study.\n\nYour part of this study is anonymous to the researcher(s). However, because of the
        nature of Internet traffic, it is possible that participants could be identified by the IP
        address or other electronic records associated with the response. We will anonymize any IP
        addresses that could be used to identify you once we have processed the data to detect
        differentiation. Any reports or publications based on this research will use only group data
        and will not identify you or any individual as being affiliated with this project.\n\nIf you
        have any questions about this study, please feel free to e-mail the project team at
        wehe@ccs.neu.edu, and the person mainly responsible for the research will respond.\n\nIf you
        have any questions about your rights in this research, you may contact:\n\n<b>Nan C.

        Have you ever wondered if your Internet service provider is slowing down certain apps
        relative to others?\n\nUnfortunately, your mobile device and carriers currently give you
        little or no way to tell if this is the case. With Wehe, we give you a way to test if this
        is happening to the Internet traffic generated by popular apps.\n\nWehe is brought to you by
        researchers at Northeastern University and UMass Amherst. By running Wehe tests, you
        contribute to a global database of tests that help us understand where and how net
        neutrality is violated. We use this data to promote a free and open Internet. You can see a
        summary of this data by clicking on the View Online Dashboard option in the
        menu.\n\nVersion: %s\n\n

        <b>Differentiation Tests</b>
        <![CDATA[\n\nWehe uses your device to exchange Internet traffic recorded from real, popular
        apps like YouTube and Spotify---effectively making it look as if you are using those
        apps.\n\nAs a result, if an Internet service provider (ISP) tries to slow down an app, like
        YouTube, Wehe would see the same behavior. We then send the same app\'s Internet traffic but
        replacing the content with randomized bytes, which prevents the ISPs from classifying the
        traffic as belonging to the app.\n\nOur hypothesis is that the randomized traffic will not
        cause an ISP to conduct application-specific differentiation (e.g., throttling or blocking),
        but the original traffic will.\n\nWe repeat these tests several times to rule out noise from
        bad network conditions, and at the end, we tell you whether your ISP is giving different
        performance to an app\'s network traffic.\n\n]]>
        <b>Port Tests</b>
        <![CDATA[\n\nThe Port Test allows users to check the performance of 12 frequently used ports.
        The test is done by comparing the performance of running https traffic for each of these
        ports against the traffic for port 443, which is used as the baseline. The test is offered
        with two different settings, using 10 MB or 50 MB data per test (beware of data consumption
        for mobile tests).\n\n]]>
