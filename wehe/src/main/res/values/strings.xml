<![CDATA[ We would like to invite you to take part in a research project. The purpose of this research study is to understand how cellular Internet providers give different performance to different network traffic from your smartphone. <br><br>For example, we would like to know if a provider is speeding up YouTube traffic and/or slowing down Netflix. We will use this information to understand how often this occurs, where this occurs and what are the implications. <br><br>We are asking you to participate in this study because you are a smartphone user who has installed our app for detecting traffic differentiation. The decision to participate in this research project is voluntary. You do not have to participate and you can uninstall the app at any time. Even if you begin using the app, you can stop at any time. You must be at least 18 years of age to participate. <br><br>You can run tests from the app as many or as few times as you like. We would like you to run tests on different networks that your mobile device connects to, and at different times of the day. <br><br>The possible risks or discomforts of the study are minimal. When you use the app, we will record the traffic it generates (including timestamps) and use this data to determine whether your Internet service provider (ISP) is interfering with your network traffic in any way. If available, we will collect information about your network, signal strength, operating system, and coarse-grained location (no more precise than a 1km radius of your location). Data concerning the network performance you receive while running tests (including timestamps), as well as information about your network, signal strength, operating system and jurisdiction (e.g., country, state, province) will be anonymized and made publicly available so that others can reproduce our findings. All other data will be shared only with co-investigators, and it will not be annotated with any personally identifiable information. <br><br>There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. However, by running the app you may help us learn more about how ISPs interfere with Internet traffic from mobile devices. You will not be paid for your participation in this study. <br><br>Your part of this study is anonymous to the researcher(s). However, because of the nature of Internet traffic, it is possible that participants could be identified by the IP address or other electronic records associated with the response. We will anonymize any IP addresses that could be used to identify you once we have processed the data to detect differentiation. Any reports or publications based on this research will use only group data and will not identify you or any individual as being affiliated with this project. <br><br>If you have any questions about this study, please feel free to e-mail the project team at wehe@ccs.neu.edu, and the person mainly responsible for the research will respond. <br><br>If you have any questions about your rights in this research, you may contact: <br><br><strong>Nan C. Regina</strong>, <br>Director, <br>Human Subject Research Protection, <br>960 Renaissance Park, <br>Northeastern University, <br>Boston, MA 02115. <br><a href="mailto:n.regina@neu.edu">n.regina@neu.edu</a><br><br> If you have any questions regarding electronic privacy, please feel free to contact: <br><br><strong>Mark Nardone</strong>, <br>NU’s Director of Information Security. <br><a href="mailto:privacy@neu.edu">privacy@neu.edu</a> <br><br>You may contact anonymously if you wish. <br><br>This study has been reviewed and approved by the Northeastern University Institutional Review Board (#14-08-16). <br><br><strong>By clicking the \"Agree\" button below you are indicating that you consent to participate in this study.

    <string name="about_text">Have you ever wondered if your Internet service provider is slowing down certain apps relative to others? Unfortunately, your mobile device and carriers currently give you little or no way to tell if this is the case. With Wehe, we give you a way to test if this is happening to the Internet traffic generated by popular apps.\n\nWehe is brought to you by researchers at Northeastern University and UMass Amherst. By running Wehe tests, you contribute to a global database of tests that help us understand where and how net neutrality is violated. We use this data to promote a free and open Internet. You can see a summary of this data by clicking on the View Online Dashboard option in the menu.</string>
    <string name="functionality_text">Wehe uses your device to exchange Internet traffic recorded from real, popular apps like YouTube and Spotify---effectively making it look as if you are using those apps. As a result, if an Internet service provider (ISP) tries to slow down an YouTube, Wehe would see the same behavior. We then send the same app\'s Internet traffic, but replacing the content with randomized bytes, which prevents the ISPs from classifying the traffic as belonging to the app. Our hypothesis is that the randomized traffic will not cause an ISP to conduct application-specific differentiation (e.g., throttling or blocking), but the original traffic will. We repeat these tests several times to rule out noise from bad network conditions, and tell you at the end whether your ISP is giving different performance to an app\'s network traffic.</string>
